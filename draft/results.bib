With this method, we can build predictive models starting with repeated time series and/or high-dimensional longitudinal data. Typical use of the method includes forecasting the future density or distribution of the variable being measured. The key innovation in our method stems from efficient algorithms to evaluate a likelihood function and its gradient. These algorithms do not rely on sampling, instead, they use repeated quadrature and the adjoint method to enable the inference to scale well as the dimensionality of the parameter vector grows. In simulated data tests, when the number of sample paths is large, the method does an excellent job of inferring drift functions close to the ground truth. We show that even when the method does not infer the drift function correctly, it still yields models with good predictive power. Finally, we apply the method to real data on hourly measurements of ground level ozone, showing that it is capable of reasonable results.},

Quantile regression trees are regression trees that model conditional quantiles of the response variable, rather than the conditional expectation as in standard regression trees. We build quantile regression trees by using the quantile loss function in our node splitting criterion. The performance of our algorithm stems from new online update procedures for both the quantile function and the quantile loss function. We test the quantile tree algorithm in three ways, comparing its running time against implementations of standard regression trees, demonstrating its ability to recover a known set of nonlinear quantile functions, and showing that quantile trees yield smaller test set errors (computed using mean absolute deviation) than standard regression trees. The tests include training sets with up to 16 million instances. Overall, our results enable future use of quantile regression trees for large-scale data mining.},

Our approach involves considering a diverse array of features including the interdisciplinarity of authors, which we quantify using Shannon entropy and Jensen-Shannon divergence. Rather than rely on subject codes, we model the disciplinary preferences of each author by estimating the author's journal distribution. We conduct an exploratory data analysis on the relationship between these interdisciplinarity variables and citation counts. In addition, we model the effects of (1) each author's influence in coauthorship graphs, and (2) words in the title of the paper. We then build classifiers for two-and three-class classification problems that correspond to predicting the interval in which a paper's citation count will lie. We use cross-validation and a true test set to tune model parameters and assess model performance. The best model we build, a classification tree, yields test set accuracies of 0.87 and 0.66, respectively. Using this model, we also provide rankings of attribute importance, for the three-class problem, these rankings indicate the importance of our interdisciplinarity metrics in predicting citation counts.},

Combining methods of principal component analysis (PCA) and L1/quantile regression, we build multivariate linear models that feature excellent in-sample fit and strong out-of-sample predictive accuracy. The combined PCA and L1 technique effectively deals with multicollinearity and non-normality of the data, and also performs favorably when compared against a variety of other models. Additionally, we propose a variable ranking procedure that explains which variables from the current quarter are most predictive of the next quarter's retained earnings. We fit models to the top five variables identified by the ranking procedure and thereby, discover interpretable models with excellent out-of-sample performance.

When one or more power lines are cut, the bus phases and load/generator power values may need to be altered in order to restore the system to operation. The load shedding problem is to find the smallest adjustment to the loads that achieves this restoration. In this work, we show how to solve this nonlinear optimization problem by solving a sequence of linear programs. On random graphs with 1500 edges, we find that our method is at least 40 times faster than competing nonlinear optimization methods. We show that our method is capable of solving load shedding problems for a real graph with 19840 edges, and that the method scales with an O(n2) running time where n is the number of edges. For real subgraphs with hundreds of edges, we are able to rapidly solve all possible load shedding problems in which at most two lines are deleted. This work takes a first step towards a scalable load shedding algorithm capable of handling large networks that will arise in the future.},

Resampling is used to correct imbalanced class distributions. Our results show that a late-stage investor may be able to leverage purely qualitative knowledge of a company’s first three rounds of funding to assess the probability that (1) the company will not go bankrupt and (2) the company will eventually make an exit of some kind (and no longer remain private). For both of these two-class classification problems, our models’ out-of-sample success rate is 75\% and the area under the ROC curve is 0.83, averaged across all sectors. Finally, we use the random forest classifier to rank the covariates based on how predictive they are.

	abstract = {Neural networks were widely used for quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) in the 1990s. Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck’s drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.},

However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at: github.com/bioinf-jku/SNNs.},

They admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation, have a simple functional form, and enjoy widespread adoption. We introduce a unified algorithm to efficiently learn a broad class of linear and non-linear state space models, including variants where the emission and transition distributions are modeled by deep neural networks. Our learning algorithm simultaneously learns a compiled inference network and the generative model, leveraging a structured variational approximation parameterized by recurrent neural networks to mimic the posterior distribution. We apply the learning algorithm to both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its scalability and versatility. We find that using the structured approximation to the posterior results in models with significantly higher held-out likelihood.},

	abstract = {Adaptive optimization methods, which perform local optimization with a metric constructed from the history of iterates, are becoming increasingly popular for training deep neural networks. Examples include AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam. We show that for simple overparameterized problems, adaptive methods often find drastically different solutions than gradient descent (GD) or stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We construct an illustrative binary classification problem where the data is linearly separable, GD and SGD achieve zero test error, and AdaGrad, Adam, and RMSProp attain test errors arbitrarily close to half. We additionally study the empirical generalization capability of adaptive methods on several state-of-the-art deep learning models. We observe that the solutions found by adaptive methods generalize worse (often significantly worse) than SGD, even when these solutions have better training performance. These results suggest that practitioners should reconsider the use of adaptive methods to train neural networks.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

However, the problem of extracting useful clinical representations from longitudinal EHR data remains challenging. In this paper, we explore deep neural network models with learned medical feature embedding to deal with the problems of high dimensionality and temporality. Specifically, we use a multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to parameterize the model and is thus able to capture complex non-linear longitudinal evolution of EHRs. Our model can effectively capture local/short temporal dependency in EHRs, which is beneficial for risk prediction. To account for high dimensionality, we use the embedding medical features in the CNN model which hold the natural medical concepts. Our initial experiments produce promising results and demonstrate the effectiveness of both the medical feature embedding and the proposed convolutional neural network in risk prediction on cohorts of congestive heart failure and diabetes patients compared with several strong baselines.},

The method applies quadrature to the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation associated with a temporal discretization of the stochastic differential equation. The inference method can be adapted to scenarios in which we have multiple observations at one time, multiple time series, or observations with large and/or irregular temporal spacing. Computational tests show that the resulting Metropolis algorithm is capable of efficient inference for an electrical oscillator model.},

	abstract = {Private companies backed by venture capitalists or private equity funds receive their funding in a series of rounds. Information about when each round occurred and which investors participated in each round has been compiled into different databases. Here we mine one such database to model how the private company will exit the VC/PE space. More specifically, we apply a random forest algorithm to each of nine sectors of private companies. Resampling is used to correct imbalanced class distributions. Our results show that a late-stage investor may be able to leverage purely qualitative knowledge of a company's first three rounds of funding to assess the probability that (1) the company will not go bankrupt and (2) the company will eventually make an exit of some kind (and no longer remain private). For both of these two-class classification problems, our models' out-of-sample success rate is 75\% and the area under the ROC curve is 0.83, averaged across all sectors. Finally, we use the random forest classifier to rank the covariates based on how predictive they are. The results indicate that the models could provide both predictive and explanatory power for business decisions.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at: github.com/bioinf-jku/SNNs.},

	abstract = {Objectives

While recent studies have demonstrated an overall increase in psychiatric visits in the emergency department (ED), none have focused on a nationally representative pediatric population. Understanding trends in pediatric psychiatric ED visits is important because of limited outpatient availability of pediatric specialists, as well as long wait times for psychiatric appointments. The study aim was to evaluate the trends in ED psychiatric visits for children between 2001 and 2010 with comparison by sociodemographic characteristics.


Methods

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of ED psychiatric visits for children {\textless} 18 years of age using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). Visits were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes. Outcome measures included frequency of visits for children with psychiatric diagnosis codes and odds and adjusted odds of psychiatric visits controlling for temporal, demographic, and geographic factors.


Results

From 2001 to 2010, an average of 28.3 million pediatric visits to EDs occurred annually. Among those, an approximately 560,000 (2\% of ED visits) were psychiatric visits each year. Pediatric psychiatric ED visits increased from an estimated 491,000 in 2001 to 619,000 in 2010 (p = 0.01). Teenagers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.92, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 3.37 to 4.57) and publicly insured patient visits (AOR = 1.47, 95\% CI = 1.25 to 1.74) had increased odds of psychiatric ED visits.


Conclusions

Pediatric ED psychiatric visits are increasing. Teenagers and children with public insurance appear to be at increased risk. Further investigation is needed to determine what the causative factors are.},

In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schrödinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},

	abstract = {Learning the governing equations in dynamical systems from time-varying measurements is of great interest across different scientific fields. This task becomes prohibitive when such data is, moreover, highly corrupted, for example, due to the recording mechanism failing over unknown intervals of time. When the underlying system exhibits chaotic behavior, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, it is crucial to recover the governing equations with high precision. In this work, we consider continuous time dynamical systems \${\textbackslash}dot\{x\} = f(x)\$ where each component of \$f: {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{d\} {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ is a multivariate polynomial of maximal degree \$p\$; we aim to identify \$f\$ exactly from possibly highly corrupted measurements \$x(t\_1), x(t\_2), {\textbackslash}dots, x(t\_m)\$. As our main theoretical result, we show that if the system is sufficiently ergodic that this data satisfies a strong central limit theorem (as is known to hold for chaotic Lorenz systems), then the governing equations \$f\$ can be exactly recovered as the solution to an \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ minimization problem---even if a large percentage of the data is corrupted by outliers. Numerically, we apply the alternating minimization method to solve the corresponding constrained optimization problem. Through several examples of three-dimensional chaotic systems and higher-dimensional hyperchaotic systems, we illustrate the power, generality, and efficiency of the algorithm for recovering governing equations from noisy and highly corrupted measurement data.},

	abstract = {Extracting governing equations from dynamic data is an essential task in model selection and parameter estimation. The form of the governing equation is rarely known a priori; however, based on the sparsity-of-effect principle one may assume that the number of candidate functions needed to represent the dynamics is very small. In this work, we leverage the sparse structure of the governing equations along with recent results from random sampling theory to develop methods for selecting dynamical systems from under-sampled data. In particular, we detail three sampling strategies that lead to the exact recovery of first-order dynamical systems when we are given fewer samples than unknowns. The first method makes no assumptions on the behavior of the data, and requires a certain number of random initial samples. The second method utilizes the structure of the governing equation to limit the number of random initializations needed. The third method leverages chaotic behavior in the data to construct a nearly deterministic sampling strategy. Using results from compressive sensing, we show that the strategies lead to exact recovery, which is stable to the sparse structure of the governing equations and robust to noise in the estimation of the velocity. Computational results validate each of the sampling strategies and highlight potential applications.},

	abstract = {Learning governing equations from a family of data sets which share the same physical laws but differ in bifurcation parameters is challenging. This is due, in part, to the wide range of phenomena that could be represented in the data sets as well as the range of parameter values. On the other hand, it is common to assume only a small number of candidate functions contribute to the observed dynamics. Based on these observations, we propose a group-sparse penalized method for model selection and parameter estimation for such data. We also provide convergence guarantees for our proposed numerical scheme. Various numerical experiments including the 1D logistic equation, the 3D Lorenz sampled from different bifurcation regions, and a switching system provide numerical validation for our method and suggest potential applications to applied dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {Big data has become a critically enabling component of emerging mathematical methods aimed at the automated discovery of dynamical systems, where first principles modeling may be intractable. However, in many engineering systems, abrupt changes must be rapidly characterized based on limited, incomplete, and noisy data. Many leading automated learning techniques rely on unrealistically large data sets and it is unclear how to leverage prior knowledge effectively to re-identify a model after an abrupt change. In this work, we propose a conceptual framework to recover parsimonious models of a system in response to abrupt changes in the low-data limit. First, the abrupt change is detected by comparing the estimated Lyapunov time of the data with the model prediction. Next, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) regression to update a previously identified model with the fewest changes, either by addition, deletion, or modification of existing model terms. We demonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system change detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems. Our examples show that sparse updates to a previously identified model perform better with less data, have lower runtime complexity, and are less sensitive to noise than identifying an entirely new model. The proposed abrupt-SINDy architecture provides a new paradigm for the rapid and efficient recovery of a system model after abrupt changes.},

	abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.

The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number of candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered disease model, Burgers’ equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.},

The number of basis functions in the drift is equipped with a prior distribution as well. For continuous data, a reversible jump Markov chain algorithm enables the exploration of the posterior over models of varying dimension.

In this tutorial we will provide a self-contained introduction to one of the state-of-the-art methods—the particle Metropolis-Hastings algorithm—which has proven to offer a practical approximation. This is a Monte Carlo based method, where the particle filter is used to guide a Markov chain Monte Carlo method through the parameter space. One of the key merits of the particle Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is that it is guaranteed to converge to the “true solution” under mild assumptions, despite being based on a particle filter with only a finite number of particles. We will also provide a motivating numerical example illustrating the method using a modeling language tailored for sequential Monte Carlo methods. The intention of modeling languages of this kind is to open up the power of sophisticated Monte Carlo methods—including particle Metropolis-Hastings—to a large group of users without requiring them to know all the underlying mathematical details.},

	abstract = {This work introduces a Gaussian variational mean-field approximation for inference in dynamical systems which can be modeled by ordinary stochastic differential equations. This new approach allows one to express the variational free energy as a functional of the marginal moments of the approximating Gaussian process. A restriction of the moment equations to piecewise polynomial functions, over time, dramatically reduces the complexity of approximate inference for stochastic differential equation models and makes it comparable to that of discrete time hidden Markov models. The algorithm is demonstrated on state and parameter estimation for nonlinear problems with up to 1000 dimensional state vectors and compares the results empirically with various well-known inference methodologies.},
